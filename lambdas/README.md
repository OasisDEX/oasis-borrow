## Lambdas

All lambdas should have a handler at index.handler.

## Build artifacts from sources

Run `npm run build` in this folder to build all lambdas or you can build each one separately by using it's own command, check `package.json` scripts.

Build artifacts will be outputted to the `/artifacts` folder, as separate zip files for each lambda function.
