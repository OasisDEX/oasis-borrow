              protocol that allows you to borrow at higher LTVs, since collateral is deposited in

        body: (
          <>
            <Text>
              The most immediate risk your position will face is that of liquidation. Liquidation
              risk is determined by the price of the collateral asset relative to your chosen
              liquidation price and LTV. If the price drops below your liquidation price, you will
              be liquidated, suffering a penalty fee charged by the protocol. You should adjust your
              risk to your preferred profile, move your risk up or down according to your needs and
              market conditions, and continually monitor your position to avoid liquidations. Your
              position also has risks associated with the underlying protocol: bugs in smart
              contracts and errors in oracle prices that force an incorrect liquidation. Morpho Blue
              borrowing has no risk associated with Governance, once deployed each market is
              isolated and its parameters are fixed.

              For Summer.fi Borrow, you can choose between Morpho Blue, Maker, AAVE and Ajna. The
              most important benefits for Morpho Blue are:
            </Text>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Higher Multiple</strong>: Morpho Blue creates isolated markets. Unlike
                multi-asset pools which must consider the riskiest asset in the basket, liquidation
                parameters for each market only need to consider the loan and collateral assets.
                Markets can have higher liquidation LTV as a result.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Wider range of markets</strong>: Morpho Blue features permissionless asset
                listing. Markets with collateral and loan assets and risk parametrization can be
                created. This will allow borrowers to unlock liquidity on assets not listed
                elsewhere.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Improved interest rates</strong>: Collateral assets are not lent out to
                borrowers. This allows Morpho Blue to offer higher capital utilization. Moreover,
                Morpho Blue is fully autonomous, so it does not need to introduce fees to cover
                costs for platform maintenance and risk managers.
              </li>
              <li>
                There are some tradeoffs regarding MaxLTV, governance risk, oracle selection and
                interest rate model between each available protocol on Summer.fi to understand
                better the differences you can read more on our{' '}
                <AppLink href={EXTERNAL_LINKS.KB.HELP}>knowledge base</AppLink>.
