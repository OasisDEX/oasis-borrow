##### Do I need to manage this Aave position?

You need to monitor this position often to asses its liquidation risk and profitability. Changes in
market conditions like the ratio of stETH/ETH or updates to the AAVE market could impact the
returns. Oasis.app will announce Governance changes from AAVE that affect this strategy. Since ETH
interest rates are variable, the profitability of this strategy changes with the demand to borrow
ETH in AAVE.

##### What are the risks?

1. Liquidation risk: If the price of stETH measured in ETH goes down the position will be at risk of
   liquidation. This could happen for multiple reasons, for example, users selling their STETH for
   ETH to pursue other strategies, perceived or realized Lido execution risk, and lower general
   liquidity. If this price goes below the liquidation ratio the position will be liquidated.
2. Lower than expected returns: The strategy assumes that the returns from ETH staking minus the
   Lido fee will be higher than the cost of borrowing ETH in AAVE allowing users to multiply this
   exposure. This assumption might not hold in all circumstances, and you should monitor the
   position to measure the profitability and desired risk.
3. Systemic risk: Smart contract bugs, and fatal errors in any of the protocols being used. Read
   more here.

##### Where does the yield come from?

The return comes first from the ETH staking yield provided by StETH. That yield is multiplied by
increasing exposure to StETH by borrowing ETH in AAVE v3. An ongoing cost of the variable ETH
borrowing rate in AAVE must be continually paid. This means that the strategy remains profitable as
long as the borrowing cost of ETH is lower than the returns from StETH.

##### Where is my capital?

This Earn position uses 3 protocols and the power of

<a href="https://oasis.app" target="_blank">Oasis.app</a>
smart contracts: All capital is deposited to AAVE v3 protocol and held there for the strategy to
work. Wrapped StETH represents ETH held by Lido, which in turn gives it to the node operators that perform
the validator duties for Lido.

##### How much does it cost?

The Oasis.app fee is 0.07% of the amount swapped to close or adjust position. The fee is waived on
setup, you can start earning as soon as you open the position. This strategy pays interest on the
ETH borrowed from AAVE. This variable fee is accounted for in the net APY, but it changes
continually as the market demands more or less ETH. Users need to take into account gas costs
related to the Ethereum network, which vary with congestion and ETH price.

##### Is this a short or long-term position?

This is a long-term position that assumes that the borrowing rate of ETH in AAVE will be lower than
the StETH yield and that the price of StETH will tend to trend in a range with respect to ETH. Once
withdrawals are enabled from the beacon chain it's expected that the ratio of StETH/ETH will move in
a tighter range.
