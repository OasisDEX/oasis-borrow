##### Do I need to manage this Aave position?

You need to monitor this position often to asses its liquidation risk and profitability. Changes in
market conditions like the ratio of stETH/ETH or updates to the AAVE market could impact the
returns. <a href="https://oasis.app" target="_blank">Oasis.app</a> will announce Governance changes
from AAVE that affect this strategy. Since ETH interest rates are variable the profitability of this
strategy changes with the demand to borrow ETH in AAVE.

##### What are the risks?

1. Liquidation risk: If the price of stETH measured in ETH goes down the position will be at risk of
   liquidation. This could happen for multiple reasons, for example, users selling their STETH for
   ETH to pursue other strategies, perceived or realized Lido execution risk, and lower general
   liquidity. If this price goes below the liquidation ratio the position will be liquidated.

2. Lower than expected returns: The strategy assumes that the returns from ETH staking minus the
   Lido fee will be higher than the cost of borrowing ETH in AAVE allowing users to multiply this
   exposure. This assumption might not hold in all circumstances and you should monitor the position
   to measure the profitability and desired risk.

3. Systemic risk: Smart contract bugs, and fatal errors in any of the protocols being used. Read
   more here.

##### How does it work?

1. A free flash loan for Dai is taken from Maker and deposited to AAVE v2 protocol.
2. ETH is borrowed to reach the desired multiple level.
3. The borrowed ETH plus the users initial deposit is swapped to StETH through 1inch.
4. The total StETH minus fee is deposited back into AAVE v2 to reach the final position
5. Dai loaned is withdrawn from AAVE and paid back to Maker.
6. The flash loan is paid back.

##### Where does the yield come from?

The return comes first from the ETH staking yield provided by StETH. That yield is multiplied by
increasing exposure to StETH by borrowing ETH. An ongoing cost of the variable ETH borrowing rate in
AAVE must be continually paid. This means that the strategy remains profitable as long as the
borrowing cost of ETH is lower than the returns from StETH.

##### Where is my capital?

This Earn position uses 3 protocols and the power of

<a href="https://oasis.app" target="_blank">Oasis.app</a> smart contracts: All capital is deposited
to AAVE v2 protocol and held there for the strategy to work. StETH represents ETH held by Lido,
which in turn gives it to the node operators that perform the validator duties for Lido.

##### How much does it cost?

The Oasis.app fee is 0.20% of the amount swapped. This fee is paid on setup and on each strategy
adjustment. This strategy pays interest on the ETH borrowed from AAVE. This variable fee is
accounted for in the net APY, but it changes continually as the market demands more or less ETH.
Users need to take into account gas costs related to the Ethereum network which vary with congestion
and ETH price.

##### Is this a short or long-term position?

This is a long-term position that assumes that the borrowing rate of ETH in AAVE will be lower than
the StETH yield and that the price of StETH will tend to trend in a range with respect to ETH. Once
withdrawals are enabled from the beacon chain it's expected that the ratio of StETH/ETH will move in
a tighter range.
