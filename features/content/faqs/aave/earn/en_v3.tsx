            You need to monitor this position often to asses its liquidation risk and profitability.
            Changes in market conditions like the ratio of stETH/ETH or updates to the AAVE market
            could impact the returns. Summer.fi will announce Governance changes from AAVE that
            affect this strategy. Since ETH interest rates are variable, the profitability of this
            strategy changes with the demand to borrow ETH in AAVE.

          <ol>
            <li>
              Liquidation risk: If the price of stETH measured in ETH goes down the position will be
              at risk of liquidation. This could happen for multiple reasons, for example, users
              selling their STETH for ETH to pursue other strategies, perceived or realized Lido
              execution risk, and lower general liquidity. If this price goes below the liquidation
              ratio the position will be liquidated.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lower than expected returns: The strategy assumes that the returns from ETH staking
              minus the Lido fee will be higher than the cost of borrowing ETH in AAVE allowing
              users to multiply this exposure. This assumption might not hold in all circumstances
              and you should monitor the position to measure the profitability and desired risk.

        body: (
          <Text>
            The return comes first from the ETH staking yield provided by StETH. That yield is
            multiplied by increasing exposure to StETH by borrowing ETH in AAVE v3. An ongoing cost
            of the variable ETH borrowing rate in AAVE must be continually paid. This means that the
            strategy remains profitable as long as the borrowing cost of ETH is lower than the
            returns from StETH.

            smart contracts: All capital is deposited to AAVE v3 protocol and held there for the
            strategy to work. Wrapped StETH represents ETH held by Lido, which in turn gives it to
            the node operators that perform the validator duties for Lido.

          <Text>
            The Summer.fi fee is 0.07% of the amount swapped to close or adjust position. The fee is
            waived on setup, you can start earning as soon as you open the position. This strategy
            pays interest on the ETH borrowed from AAVE. This variable fee is accounted for in the
            net APY, but it changes continually as the market demands more or less ETH. Users need
            to take into account gas costs related to the Ethereum network, which vary with
            congestion and ETH price.

        title: 'Is this a short or long-term position?',
        body: (
          <Text>
            This is a long-term position that assumes that the borrowing rate of ETH in AAVE will be
            lower than the StETH yield and that the price of StETH will tend to trend in a range
            with respect to ETH. Once withdrawals are enabled from the beacon chain it's expected
            that the ratio of StETH/ETH will move in a tighter range.
