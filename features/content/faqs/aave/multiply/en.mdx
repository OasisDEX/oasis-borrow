##### What is Oasis.app Multiply Aave?

Oasis.app multiply with Aave is a feature that allows you to get increased exposure to your assets
with one click. You can deposit supported collaterals into Aave and with the power of Oasis.app
smart contracts you can multiply your exposure to it by borrowing USDC within Aave protocol.

##### How does it work?

When you open a new position you will select a collateral and a Loan to Value(LTV) according to your
desired risk and reward, and in a single transaction, Oasis.app will deposit your collateral to
Aave, borrow USDC and purchase more collateral with it, depositing it back into the protocol. This
way, you will obtain increased exposure to your assets against USDC.

To start you will need to create a

  Smart Defi Account
</a>
, each Oasis.app multiply with Aave position will use a single Smart Defi Account to isolate your position,
this feature allows you to manage more than one account at Aave from a single wallet.

##### What are the risks?

With Multiply, you are exposed to increased volatility from your assets. This means you will get
greater returns measured against your initial deposit in case it rises, but you will suffer
increased losses in case the price goes against you. If your LTV goes above the liquidation
threshold, you will be liquidated, suffering a penalty fee charged by the protocol. You should
adjust your multiple to your preferred risk profile, move your risk up or down according to your
needs and market conditions, and continually monitor your position to avoid liquidations. Aave has a
buffer between the maximum LTV and the liquidation threshold to give you some time to repay your
debt.

Your position has risks associated with the underlying protocol: bugs in smart contracts and errors
in oracle prices that force an incorrect liquidation. You should be aware that a lending protocol
also has governance risk, this means that decisions made by the protocol can impact your position.
It's expected to see changes to the interest rate curve, liquidation and LTV parameters, adding or
removing support for collaterals. As Aave protocol is a unified liquidity pool, these changes could
impact your position directly or indirectly.

##### What are the differences between supported protocols for Oasis.app Multiply?

For Oasis.app Multiply, you can choose between Maker and AAVE. The most important differences with
each protocol are:

1. Maker has a 1-hour delay between oracle updates. This means that a position only becomes
   uncollateralized with a one-hour delay, allowing you more time to unwind your position. For Aave,
   liquidations are instantaneous, but this allows the protocol to have a lower penalty fee for
   liquidation. The liquidation penalty for each asset can be seen in the liquidation price tooltip.
   Maker uses its own oracle network to report prices, while Aave utilizes Chainlink services.
2. Aave supports higher multiples and pays interest on the collateral deposited since it works with
   a single pool for lending and borrowing. This means that in cases where the protocol fails to
   properly deal with defaulting accounts and is left with bad debt, the risk is spread across all
   users of the protocol.
3. Aave has, in general, support for different tokens both as collateral and debt, allowing you to
   multiply in more ways.

These are some of the main factors that you should consider when choosing an underlying protocol for
Multiply. You can always ask more questions in our

##### How much does it cost?

Oasis.app charges a fee per Multiply action of 0.2% over the required swap. We source free flash
loans from multiple providers to guarantee the best execution. Your Multiply position will pay a
variable borrowing fee to Aave and will get paid a variable lending fee for providing liquidity to
Aave. You can see this in your 'Net Borrowing Cost' in the main view. As usual, Ethereum gas fees
will apply, with the value dependent on the network conditions. Oasis.app doesn't charge anything
for standard actions that you can make by using the underlying protocol, this includes borrowing,
paying back debt, depositing or withdrawing collateral tokens.
