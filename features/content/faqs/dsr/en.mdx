##### How does it work?

When you login to Oasis.app and deposit into the Dai Savings Rate Earn Strategy, you will be locking
your DAI into a Smart Contract which will accrue more DAI at the shown annual percentage yield
(APY). MakerDAO pays to deposits in the Dai Saving Rate the shown APY continuously on every block.
You can deposit as much as you want and withdraw at any moment. There are no lock-ups and no fees
for using the Dai Savings Rate.

##### Do I need to manage this Earn position?

You don't need to manage this positions, you will Earn more Dai at the rate shown continuously until
the rate is adjusted by MakerDAO. Rate could be adjusted up or down without prior notice, in general
rate adjustments will be announced in advance, and we will communicate the changes in all our
channels such as Discord or Twitter. You don't need to do anything if the Dai Savings Rate changes.
You can leave your Dai in the DSR as long for as long as you see fit.

##### Where does the yield come from?

The yield comes from the profits generated by MakerDAO. Since Maker wants Dai to be used extensively
in DeFi it has a mechanism for incentivizing users to hold Dai. Redistributing a part of the profits
of MakerDAO for the Dai Savings Rate makes Dai grow. To understand the DSR, it could be compared to
base rates of different fiat currencies since the yield comes directly from the entity that works to
back the coin. This, in turn, has the same effect as what happens in the world of currencies: users
are incentivized to swap other coins with no base rate for Dai. This increases the demand and supply
of Dai making it more used, which is the end goal of Maker: to have DAI as a leading stablecoin in
DeFi.

##### What are the risks?

1. Lower than expected returns: Maker makes no promise of how long the Dai Savings Rate will be at
   the shown level. If the Dai Savings Rate changes, users can leave their money deposited there
   until the rate changes again, decide to withdraw or deposit more. The changes only affect the
   rate of earning, the principal deposited is always available for withdrawal. Dai in the DSR has
   no lockup, money is not lent out or used in any fashion.

2. Systemic risk: Oasis.app works tirelessly to have the safest and most trusted platform to deploy
   capital and conducts regular audits of its contracts and places security as the top priority,
   nevertheless blockchains have unavoidable risks arising from smart contract bugs or fatal errors
   in any protocols being used.

##### Where is my capital?

Your Dai is deposited into a

  dedicated contract
</a> within the Maker Protocol commonly referred to as the Dai Savings Rate.

##### How much does it cost?

This Earn Strategy is free of charge, all you have to pay for are the gas fees for each transaction.

##### Is this a short or long-term position?

This is a long-term position, you can leave your Dai in the Dai Saving Rate contract for as long as
you need or wish to. Even in cases where Maker reduces the Dai Savings Rate your Dai will remain
there until you withdraw it.
