            You need to monitor this position often to assess its liquidation risk and
            profitability. Changes in market conditions like the ratio of your collateral to debt or
            updates to the Spark market could impact the returns. Summer.fi will announce Governance
            changes from Spark that affect this strategy. Since ETH interest rates are variable, the
            profitability of this strategy changes with the demand to borrow ETH in Spark.

          <ol>
            <li>
              Liquidation risk: If the price of your liquid staking token measured in ETH goes down
              the position will be at risk of liquidation. This could happen for multiple reasons,
              for example, users selling their liquid staking token for ETH to pursue other
              strategies, perceived or realized staking provider execution risk, and lower general
              liquidity. If this price goes below the liquidation ratio the position will be
              liquidated.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lower than expected returns: The strategy assumes that the returns from ETH staking
              minus the fees will be higher than the cost of borrowing ETH in Spark allowing users
              to multiply this exposure. This assumption might not hold in all circumstances, and
              you should monitor the position to measure the profitability and desired risk.
            </li>
            <li>
              Systemic risk: Smart contract bugs, and fatal errors in any of the protocols being
              used.

          <Text>
            The return comes first from the ETH staking yield provided by the liquid staking token.
            That yield is multiplied by increasing exposure to your liquid staking token by
            borrowing ETH in Spark. An ongoing cost of the variable ETH borrowing rate in Spark must
            be continually paid. This means that the strategy remains profitable as long as the
            borrowing cost of ETH is lower than the returns from your liquid staking token.

            smart contracts: All capital is deposited to Spark protocol and held there for the
            strategy to work. Your liquid staking token represents ETH held by your liquid staking
            provider, which in turn gives it to the node operators that perform the validator
            duties.

            The Summer.fi fee is 0.07% of the amount swapped to close or decrease position. The fee
            is waived on setup, you can start earning as soon as you open the position. This
            strategy pays interest on the ETH borrowed from Spark. This variable fee is accounted
            for in the net APY, but it changes continually as the market demands more or less ETH.
            Users need to take into account gas costs related to the Ethereum network, which vary
            with congestion and ETH price.

          <Text>
            This is a long-term position that assumes that the borrowing rate of ETH in Spark will
            be lower than the liquid staking token yield and that the price of the liquid staking
            token will tend to trend in a range with respect to ETH.
