##### Do I need to manage this Spark position?

You need to monitor this position often to assess its liquidation risk and profitability. Changes in
market conditions like the ratio of your collateral to debt or updates to the Spark market could
impact the returns. Summer.fi will announce Governance changes from Spark that affect this strategy.
Since ETH interest rates are variable, the profitability of this strategy changes with the demand to
borrow ETH in Spark.

##### What are the risks?

1. Liquidation risk: If the price of your liquid staking token measured in ETH goes down the
   position will be at risk of liquidation. This could happen for multiple reasons, for example,
   users selling their liquid staking token for ETH to pursue other strategies, perceived or
   realized staking provider execution risk, and lower general liquidity. If this price goes below
   the liquidation ratio the position will be liquidated.
2. Lower than expected returns: The strategy assumes that the returns from ETH staking minus the
   fees will be higher than the cost of borrowing ETH in Spark allowing users to multiply this
   exposure. This assumption might not hold in all circumstances, and you should monitor the
   position to measure the profitability and desired risk.
3. Systemic risk: Smart contract bugs, and fatal errors in any of the protocols being used.

##### Where does the yield come from?

The return comes first from the ETH staking yield provided by the liquid staking token. That yield
is multiplied by increasing exposure to your liquid staking token by borrowing ETH in Spark. An
ongoing cost of the variable ETH borrowing rate in Spark must be continually paid. This means that
the strategy remains profitable as long as the borrowing cost of ETH is lower than the returns from
your liquid staking token.

##### Where is my capital?

This Earn position uses 3 protocols and the power of

<a href="https://summer.fi" target="_blank">
  Summer.fi
</a>
smart contracts: All capital is deposited to Spark protocol and held there for the strategy to work.
Your liquid staking token represents ETH held by your liquid staking provider, which in turn gives it
to the node operators that perform the validator duties.

##### How much does it cost?

The Summer.fi fee is 0.07% of the amount swapped to close or decrease position. The fee is waived on
setup, you can start earning as soon as you open the position. This strategy pays interest on the
ETH borrowed from Spark. This variable fee is accounted for in the net APY, but it changes
continually as the market demands more or less ETH. Users need to take into account gas costs
related to the Ethereum network, which vary with congestion and ETH price.

##### Is this a short or long-term position?

This is a long-term position that assumes that the borrowing rate of ETH in Spark will be lower than
the liquid staking token yield and that the price of the liquid staking token will tend to trend in
a range with respect to ETH.
