##### What is Summer.fi Multiply with Spark?

Summer.fi multiply with Spark is a feature that allows you to get increased exposure to your assets
with one click. You can deposit supported collaterals into Spark and with the power of Summer.fi
smart contracts you can multiply your exposure to it by borrowing debt within Spark protocol.

##### How does it work?

When you open a new position you will select a collateral and a Loan to Value(LTV) according to your
desired risk and reward, and in a single transaction, Summer.fi will deposit your collateral to
Spark, borrow debt and purchase more collateral with it, depositing it back into the protocol. This
way, you will obtain increased exposure to your assets against your selected debt token.

To start you will need to create a

<a href={EXTERNAL_LINKS.KB.WHAT_IS_DPM} target="_blank">
  Smart Defi Account
</a>
, each Summer.fi Multiply with Spark position will use a single Smart Defi Account to isolate your position,
this feature allows you to manage more than one account at Spark from a single wallet.

##### What are the risks?

With Multiply, you are exposed to increased volatility from your assets. This means you will get
greater returns measured against your initial deposit in case it rises, but you will suffer
increased losses in case the price goes against you. If your LTV goes above the liquidation
threshold, you will be liquidated, suffering a penalty fee charged by the protocol. You should
adjust your multiple to your preferred risk profile, move your risk up or down according to your
needs and market conditions, and continually monitor your position to avoid liquidations. Spark has
a buffer between the maximum LTV and the liquidation threshold to give you some time to repay your
debt.

Your position has risks associated with the underlying protocol: bugs in smart contracts and errors
in oracle prices that force an incorrect liquidation. You should be aware that a lending protocol
also has governance risk, this means that decisions made by the protocol can impact your position.
It's expected to see changes to the interest rate curve, liquidation and LTV parameters, adding or
removing support for collaterals. As Spark protocol is a unified liquidity pool, these changes could
impact your position directly or indirectly.

##### What are the differences between supported protocols for Summer.fi Multiply?

For Summer.fi Multiply, you can choose between Maker, AAVE, Spark and Ajna.

Spark protocol is a fork of Aave v3, governed by a sub-division of MakerDAO. The main difference
between Spark & Aave is that the rate for borrowing DAI is not fluctuating with every deposit, but
is predictably set by the Maker governance. It changes about every two weeks.

The most important differences with the other protocols are:

1. Maker, Aave, Spark use oracles. Maker has a 1-hour delay between oracle updates. This means that
   a position only becomes uncollateralized with a one-hour delay, allowing you more time to unwind
   your position. For Aave and Spark, liquidations are instantaneous, but this allows the protocol
   to have a lower penalty fee for liquidation. The liquidation penalty for each asset can be seen
   in the liquidation price tooltip. Maker uses its own oracle network to report prices, while Aave
   & Spark utilizes Chainlink services. Ajna does not use internal oracles.
2. Aave and Spark support higher multiples and pays interest on the collateral deposited since it
   works with a single pool for lending and borrowing. This means that in cases where the protocol
   fails to properly deal with defaulting accounts and is left with bad debt, the risk is spread
   across all users of the protocol.
3. Aave has, in general, support for different tokens both as collateral and debt, allowing you to
   borrow different tokens.

These are some of the main factors that you should consider when choosing an underlying protocol for
Multiply. You can always ask more questions in our

##### How much does it cost?

Summer.fi charges a fee per Multiply action of 0.2% over the required swap. We source free flash
loans from multiple providers to guarantee the best execution. Your Multiply position will pay a
variable borrowing fee to Spark and will get paid a variable lending fee for providing liquidity to
Spark. You can see this in your 'Net Borrowing Cost' in the main view. As usual, Ethereum gas fees
will apply, with the value dependent on the network conditions. Summer.fi doesn't charge anything
for standard actions that you can make by using the underlying protocol, this includes borrowing,
paying back debt, depositing or withdrawing collateral tokens.
