##### What is Summer.fi Borrow with Spark?

Summer.fi borrow with Spark allows you to easily borrow against your crypto collateral. You choose a
pair with a collateral token and a borrow token, and you enter a deposit amount and an amount to
borrow to get started. You can use the borrowed amount in any way. Spark loans are perpetual, with a
predictable interest rate for borrowing DAI. Borrowing other tokens has a variable interest rate.
The collateral is deposited in Spark on which you receive some interest, whilst you are paying an
interest on the amount borrowed.

##### How does it work?

When you open a new position you will select a collateral and an amount to borrow. Thereby
determining your Loan to Value(LTV) according to your desired risk and reward. Within the
transaction you will deposit your collateral to Spark, and borrow the chosen debt. When the
transaction is successful, you will obtain the borrowed amount in your wallet.

To start you will need to create a

<a href={EXTERNAL_LINKS.KB.WHAT_IS_DPM} target="_blank">
  Smart Defi Account
</a>
, each Summer.fi Borrow with Spark position will use a single Smart Defi Account to isolate your position,
this feature allows you to manage more than one account at Spark from a single wallet.

##### What are the risks?

When borrowing you need to look after your liquidation price & LTV. If your LTV goes above the
liquidation threshold, you will be liquidated, suffering a penalty fee charged by the protocol. You
should adjust your risk to your preferred profile, move your risk up or down according to your needs
and market conditions, and continually monitor your position to avoid liquidations. Spark has a
buffer between the maximum LTV and the liquidation threshold to give you some time to repay your
debt.

Your position has risks associated with the underlying protocol: bugs in smart contracts and errors
in oracle prices that force an incorrect liquidation. You should be aware that the Spark protocol
also has governance risk, this means that decisions made by the protocol can impact your position.
It's expected to see changes to the interest rate curve, liquidation and LTV parameters, adding or
removing support for collaterals. As Spark protocol is a unified liquidity pool, these changes could
impact your position directly or indirectly.

##### What are the differences between supported protocols for Summer.fi Borrow?

For Summer.fi Borrow, you can choose between Maker, AAVE, Spark and Ajna. Spark protocol is a fork
of Aave v3, governed by a sub-division of MakerDAO. The main difference between Spark & Aave is that
the rate for borrowing DAI is not fluctuating with every deposit, but is predictably set by the
Maker governance. It changes about every two weeks. The most important differences with each
protocol are:

1. Maker, Aave, Spark use oracles. Maker has a 1-hour delay between oracle updates. This means that
   a position only becomes uncollateralized with a one-hour delay, allowing you more time to unwind
   your position. For Aave and Spark, liquidations are instantaneous, but this allows the protocol
   to have a lower penalty fee for liquidation. The liquidation penalty for each asset can be seen
   in the liquidation price tooltip. Maker uses its own oracle network to report prices, while Aave
   & Spark utilizes Chainlink services. Ajna does not use internal oracles.
2. Aave and Spark support higher multiples and pays interest on the collateral deposited since it
   works with a single pool for lending and borrowing. This means that in cases where the protocol
   fails to properly deal with defaulting accounts and is left with bad debt, the risk is spread
   across all users of the protocol.
3. Aave has, in general, support for different tokens both as collateral and debt, allowing you to
   borrow different tokens.

These are some of the main factors that you should consider when choosing an underlying protocol for

##### How much does it cost?

Depositing and borrowing actions are completely free of charge! When you are using the one-click
risk adjustment actions available in multiply, Summer.fi charges a fee of 0.2% over the required
swap. We source free flash loans from multiple providers to guarantee the best execution. Your
Borrow position will pay a variable borrowing fee to Spark and will get paid a variable lending fee
for providing liquidity to Spark. You can see this in your 'Net Borrowing Cost' in the main view. As
usual, Ethereum gas fees will apply, with the value dependent on the network conditions.
