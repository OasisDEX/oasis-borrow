##### How does borrowing work?

Ajna is a unique lending protocol with no oracles and no governance. Each Borrow position is tied to
a single collateral/debt pair. You can borrow up to the dynamic max LTV offered by the collective of
pool lenders. The dynamic max LTV is set by the market activity, completely autonomously from any
governance. Volatility, market demand and asset risk evaluation done by lenders converges on an
offered max LTV, even if this changes, you, as a borrower are in control at all times of your
liquidation price. Without oracles, liquidators are forced to post a bond to ensure liquidations
only happen on bad loans. Rates are variable set by the pool utilization, there is no repayment
schedule and listing of tokens happens permissionless.

##### What are the risks?

There are 4 main risks when borrowing in Ajna:

1. **Liquidations**: If the value of your collateral goes down or the value of your debt goes up
   your position will be liquidated to recover the borrowed amount. Penalties apply to liquidated
   loans. You must monitor your liquidation price to make sure the external market price is above
   it.
2. **Unsuccessful liquidations**: If a loan is liquidated, you might be left with some collateral
   after the debt is recovered by the protocol and the penalties are paid. But during times of high
   volatility, the protocol might not recover all the debt or the price at which your collateral is
   sold could be suboptimal. This means that in some cases you might not recover any collateral
   after liquidations.
3. **Spurious liquidations**: Loans can be liquidated at any moment in Ajna, but the protocol works
   by forcing liquidators to post a bond to liquidate a loan to avoid spurious liquidations. In some
   cases, liquidators might have incentives to force a spurious liquidation if the losses they take
   are lower than some other gain: For example, they were paid to grief you. This is not expected to
   happen to regular users.
4. **Systemic risk**: Ajna is a new bold take in lending protocols, such innovation carries risk
   from smart contract bugs and design flaws, as the protocol gets used, and its design is battle
   tested confidence in the system will grow.

##### What are the liquidation penalties?

There are 2 liquidation penalties:

1. **90 days of interest**: Once a loan is scheduled for liquidation. After this, they have 1-hour
   grace period where they can repay or recollateralize their loan.
2. **7% of the total debt**: After the grace period has concluded, a new penalty is applied as
   liquidation starts. During liquidations, users can still repay or recollateraize their position.
   If a loan is recollateralized during a liquidation, it will be removed from the liquidation
   engine. (penalties still apply for partial liquidations)

##### How is the borrow rate set?

Interest rates are set autonomously based on utilization, with a 12 hours adjustment period. On each
adjustment period, the interest rate can move at most 10%. This means that if the borrow rate is 2%
after 24 hours, 2 adjustments have happened with the upper limit being 2.42% and the lower limit
1.62%.

##### What happens if my loan gets liquidated?

If your loan is scheduled for liquidation, 90 days of interest penalty will be applied first. You
will have 1 hour to cover your debt or add more collateral. After that time has passed, the loan
will be moved to a liquidation auction where the collateral will be sold to cover the debt and a 7%
penalty will be applied. If the loan is successfully liquidated, the debt will be recovered and any
collateral left will be left for you to withdraw. Liquidations can happen partially and in cases
where a loan collateralized during the auction it will be moved out of it. At all times during this
process you can repay your debt or add more collateral to recollateralize your position.

##### What are the token rewards?

Selected pools receive Summer.fi x Ajna rewards weekly. These rewards incentivize early adopters of
Ajna who use Summer.fi Smart DeFi Account. It accrues automatically with no staking needed and can

##### How much does it cost?

The following costs are associated with borrowing in Ajna:

1. **Origination Fee**: The origination fee is calculated as the greater of the current annualized
   borrower interest rate divided by 52 (one week of interest) or 5 bps multiplied by the loan’s new
   debt. This applies to each new debt action
2. **Borrow Rate**: Set by pool utilization, this is an ongoing cost of borrowing that’s variable
   and updates up to 10% every 12 hours.
3. **Liquidation Penalties**: In case of liquidation, 90 days of interest are applied as first
   penalty during a 1 hour grace period. Afterwards the loan starts to be liquidated and a 7%
   penalty is added to the total debt.
4. **Transaction fees**: Standard gas fees applies to the usage of the protocol and are determined
   by network demand.
5. **Summer.fi Fees**: Basic borrow actions such as borrow and repay debt, add or withdraw
   collateral are free. Advance actions and automations have their own associated fee.

##### Is there a minimum or maximum I can borrow?

The minimum borrow size is 10% of the average loan size. The maximum loan is determined by the total
liquidity in the pool. When you simulate a new loan, you will be able to see how much you need to
borrow to open a new position and how much you can borrow with your collateral or if you are limited
by the pool liquidity.
