##### Do I need to manage this Ajna position?

You need to monitor this position to be sure your lending price is lower than the current external
market price of the collateral token and that it's high enough to be providing liquidity in a range
that gets paid interest. Lending in Ajna doesn't work the same as lending in other protocols and
requires a more active approach to monitor collateral volatility, in turn Ajna has no risk from
faulty oracles or misbehaving governance since there is none.

##### What are the risks?

There are 4 main risks when lending in Ajna.

1. You are left with collateral tokens: If your lending price is close to market and the price of
   the collateral token goes below it, you will be left with only collateral tokens to claim. Your
   lending price acts as a limit order in that case.
2. Unable to withdraw: During liquidations, the utilized part of the pool up to the amount of tokens
   being recovered from borrowers is frozen. This means that while liquidations last, your liquidity
   might not be available for withdrawal in all cases. Liquidations should last at least 6 hours,
   after which you will be able to withdraw normally if the liquidation was successful.
3. Not receiving interest: Deposits below the minimum yield point will receive no interest, since
   these deposits are not actively lent out nor work as backup liquidity.
4. System risk: Ajna is a new bold take in lending protocols, such innovation carries risk from
   smart contract bugs and design flaws, as the protocol gets used, and its design is battle tested
   confidence in the system will grow.

##### How does it work?

Ajna is a lending protocol with no oracles or governance. Since there is no governance to set
parameters, the protocol relies on lenders properly setting their tokens at the correct lending
price, which implies a certain Loan to Value ratio to get the right lending market values. At the
same time, the lack of oracles means that the protocol must implement a novel liquidation mechanism
where liquidators must post a bond previous to loan liquidations to guarantee that the external
market price is effectively below the liquidation price of the loan. In this way both lenders and
borrowers are incentivized, driven by market mechanism, to reach a successful loan, and thanks to
this autonomous mechanism in Ajna any token can be lent or borrowed.

##### Where does the yield come from?

The yield comes from the interest rate charged to Ajna protocol Borrowers of the selected pool. This
yield is annualized at current utilization rates. If the pool has a lot of demand and utilized
liquidity goes up the rate will go up and if it has little use the rate will go down.

##### What are the token rewards?

Selected pools receive Summer.fi × Ajna rewards weekly. These rewards incentivize early adopters of
Ajna who use Summer.fi Smart DeFi Account. It accrues automatically with no staking needed and can
be claimed weekly after tokens are released.

##### How much does it cost?

Lending in Ajna is free. The protocol charges a 1 day of interest for deposits below the active
liquidity range to incentivize meaningful lending activity. This means you will pay in the no yield
range and the backup liquidity range but nothing at the active liquidity lending range or above.
