WE MAKE AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, AND WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES AND THE CODE PROPRIETARY OR OPEN SOURCE, WE SPECIFICALLY DO NOT REPRESENT AND WARRANT AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, USAGE, SECURITY, SUITABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR AS TO THE WORKMANSHIP OR TECHNICAL CODING THEREOF, OR THE ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES, CODE AND ANY RELATED INFORMATION ARE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, RELIABLE, CURRENT OR ERROR-FREE.

To the fullest extent permitted by law and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated herein or applicable provisions of law or equity or otherwise, the parties hereto hereby agree to eliminate any and all fiduciary duties Company may have to the user, its affiliates, or the end users of the Services, the site or its content, provided that such exclusion or limitation of liability shall not extend to the Company’s misappropriation of assets or funds of its users or its affiliates, or the end users of the Services, Site or content provided by Company or other acts or omissions that constitute a bad faith violation of the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

### 4.3 Sophistication and Risk of Cryptographic Systems

By utilizing the Services or interacting with the Site in any way, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems; and warrant that you have an understanding of the usage and intricacies of native cryptographic tokens, like Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), smart contract based tokens such as those that follow the Ethereum Token Standard (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20), and blockchain-based software systems.

The Company does not own or control any of the underlying software through which blockchain networks are formed. In general, the underlying software for blockchain networks tends to be open source such that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute it. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree (i) that Company is not responsible for operation of the underlying software and networks that there exists no guarantee of functionality, security, or availability of such software and networks; and (ii) that the underlying protocols are subject to sudden changes in operating rules (known as “ Forks ”), and that such Forks may materially affect the Services. It might be discretionarily decided not to support (or cease supporting) the Forked network entirely. You acknowledge and agree that Company assumes absolutely no responsibility whatsoever in respect of any underlying software protocols, whether Forked or not.

Underlying networks use public/private key cryptography. You alone are responsible for securing your private key(s). Company does not have access to your private key(s). Losing control of your private key will permanently and irreversibly deny you access to funds on the Ethereum blockchain or other network. Neither Company nor any other person will be able to retrieve or protect your funds. Once your private key(s) is lost, you will not be able to transfer your Digital Assets to any other address or wallet. If this occurs, you will not be able to realize any value or utility that you may hold now or in future.

### 4.4 Risk of Regulatory Actions in One or More Jurisdictions

The Services, Digital Assets and ETH could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory action, which could impede or limit the ability of Company to continue to develop, or which could impede or limit your ability to access or use the Services or Ethereum blockchain, including access to your Digital Assets or other funds.

### 4.5 Risk of Weaknesses or Exploits in the Field of Cryptography

You acknowledge and understand that Cryptography is a progressing field. Advances in code cracking or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers may present risks to cryptocurrencies, Digital Assets and Services, which could result in the theft or loss of your Digital Assets or property.

By using the Services or accessing the Site, you acknowledge these inherent risks.

### 4.6 Volatility of Cryptocurrency

You understand that Ethereum and other blockchain technologies and associated Digital Assets, currencies or tokens are highly volatile due to many factors including but not limited to adoption, speculation, technology and security risks. You also acknowledge that the cost of transacting on such technologies is variable and may increase at any time causing impact to any activities taking place on the Ethereum blockchain. You acknowledge these risks and represent that Company cannot be held liable for such fluctuations or increased costs.
