This Agreement hereby incorporates by this reference any additional terms and conditions with respect to the Site posted by Company to the Site, or otherwise made available to you by Company. 


**IMPORTANT: ** This Agreement contains a mandatory individual Arbitration clause and class action and jury trial waivers that require the use of arbitration by Users on an individual basis to resolve Disputes, rather than jury trials or class actions or similar group actions.

## 1. Use of Services 
### 1.1. Services 
The Company has developed Oasis – an online, decentralized and autonomous environment that displays price information and autonomous smart contract mechanisms of digital tokens and assets (“Digital Assets”) – and provides the user-interface that guides your access to Oasis; the Site is used to provide Users with access to certain decentralized finance services and products on the Ethereum blockchain through Oasis (the “Services.”) The Services may require users to pay fees, such as gas charges on the Ethereum network, to perform a transaction.

User affirms that the User is aware and acknowledges that Company is a noncustodial provider of software services, meaning that the Company does not custody, control, or manage User funds in any manner whatsoever.

## 4. Rewards Program Terms:
The Company offers its Users the opportunity to earn Rewards by referring other Users to enter into qualified transactions using the Services. The Rewards are for promotional purposes only, as part of the Company Rewards Program ("Rewards Program" or "Program").  By joining the Program, you and Users you refer can earn Rewards payable in DAI. 


These Rewards Program Terms (“Program Terms”) apply to a User's participation in the Program. By participating in the Program, Users agree to use the Program as outlined herein, and consistent with any other terms we may apply to the Program. If you do not agree to these Rewards Program Terms in their entirety, then you cannot participate in the Program. Users also cannot participate where, by so doing, they would violate any applicable law or regulations that may apply to that User.


Eligibility
---
This Program is void where such programs are prohibited. Users who refer other users who join the Program are "Referrers"; those who are referred to the Program are "Referred Users." Referrers may be eligible to receive Rewards for every qualified transaction by a Referred User. Referrers must speak and read English, must be legally able to participate in the Program, and must be 1) at least the age of majority where they reside and 2) be an existing User of the Services. 


Please see the Company’s Privacy Policy for further details on your privacy rights.


How It Works
---
To participate, a User generates a referral code by browsing to the Oasis.app web site and clicking the “copy referral link” button. Once that User generates and distributes that referral code to another User that accepts to be referred after they have accepted the Program Terms via wallet transaction, that second User becomes a Referred User, and that User who distributed the referral code becomes a Referrer. Referrers can share their referral code with other Users who may use that code to receive Services from the Company using their self-custodial wallet by visiting Oasis.app and inserting the referral code when prompted at the appropriate URL (currently https://oasis.app/referrals). The User who receives the referral code and clicks it or otherwise manually enters the URL will be prompted to access, review, and accept these Program Terms by signing a transaction through that User’s wallet. After that User clicks to accept these Program Terms, that User will be a Referred User. Both a Referrer, and a Referred User may be able to claim Rewards in an amount equal to 5% of all fees thereafter generated by the Referred User for transactions of Oasis Multiply, of Oasis Earn, or any of the Oasis automated trigger executions (hereinafter a “qualified transaction.”). 


Once the Referred User has performed a qualified transaction, both Referrer and the Referred User will see on the Oasis.app referral page  (https://oasis.app/referrals) a balance accumulating that they are able to 'Claim' each week. The Oasis.app Referral page will update the Rewards balance that is available to be claimed by Referrers and Referred Users.  A Referrer or Referred User may claim their outstanding Rewards balance by browsing to the Oasis.app referral page and clicking the Claim button, and interacting with the smart contract using their wallet to claim the Rewards available to them. 


Conditions for Receiving Rewards
---
1. If a Referred User receives more than one referral code, only the User whose referral link is first used by a Referred User may be eligible for Rewards. 
2. The Referred User may not combine the referral code received from the Referrer with any other offer that results in the payment of Rewards.
3. The Referred User be qualified to use the services provided by the Company under these Program Terms.
4. No purchase is required to participate in the Rewards program, but a Referred User must engage in at least one qualified transaction for either a Referrer or Referred User to receive or claim any Rewards. 
5. Referrers and Referred Users must respect the spirit of the Program by not engaging in spamming or other unfair or otherwise problematic practices, including creating fake accounts, or harassing potential referral sources.




How Rewards Work
---
Users who participate in the Program are able to earn and accumulate Rewards that can be redeemed for DAI. Referrers and Referred Users are eligible to begin to receive Rewards as long as this Program is offered by the Company and as long as Referrers and Referred Users otherwise qualify for the Program. 
Referrers may refer an unlimited number of Users to the Program. 




Use of Rewards
---
Referrers and Referred Users will have 6 months to redeem their Rewards by claiming any Rewards. Unclaimed Rewards will be voided and returned to the Company.  For example, if a User earns Rewards on January 15, 2023, those Rewards will expire on January 31, 2024.  Expiration dates cannot be modified or extended.


If a Referrer's or Referred User’s participation in the Rewards Program is terminated for any reason, unclaimed Rewards are void. Prior to redemption, Rewards may not be sold, transferred or assigned to, or shared with, any other person. Rewards have no value until claimed. Rewards have no cash value and may not be redeemed for cash, goods or services. Rewards are intended for the User’s use only. Commercial use of Rewards is prohibited. Your Rewards are personal to you and may not be sold, transferred or assigned to, or shared with, any other person. You may have only one Rewards account per wallet address for the Rewards Program.

Use of any automated system not typical of users of the Site and Services to participate in the Program is strictly prohibited, and if discovered, will result in disqualification. The Company reserves the right to disqualify any User, cancel Rewards, disable or suspend a User from the Program Rewards account, and contact legal authorities (including law enforcement), if it should discover a User is tampering with the entry or referral process or the operation of the Program or violating these Terms. 


Reservations of Rights
---
The Company may withhold or invalidate a Reward if it reasonably believes that any Reward would violate any law or legal requirement, or if the Company believes any use of the Site or the Services by any Referrer or Referred User is fraudulent, suspect, or in violation of these Program Terms. 


If the Company, in its sole discretion, believes that to award Rewards will impose liability on the Company, its subsidiaries, affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents, the Company may, at its sole discretion, not award any Rewards for any given transaction.


All of the Company’s decisions related to the Program are final and binding, except where prohibited, including decisions as to whether a Referral, or qualified transaction, is valid, when and if to terminate the Program, to terminate any User’s participation in the Program or disqualify any User from participation in the Program, and whether, if at all, to change the Program.

Any changes to the Program will be noted in these Terms as they may be updated from time to time, and, except where prohibited, will become effective as of the date the Terms are updated. Please check these Terms frequently. If a Referrer has Rewards pending at the time that the Program is updated or changed, those pending Rewards shall be honored under the Terms that were valid at the time the qualified transaction giving rise to the Rewards.

We reserve the right to disqualify any User at any time from participation in the Program if he/she does not comply with any of these Terms.

The Company does not own or control any of the underlying software or hardware through which blockchain networks are formed and operated. In general, the underlying software for blockchain networks tends to be open source such that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute it. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree (i) that Company is not responsible for operation of the underlying software, hardware, and networks that there exists no guarantee of functionality, security, or availability of such software and networks; and (ii) that the underlying protocols are subject to sudden changes in operating rules (known as “ Forks ”), and that such Forks may materially affect the Services.

Advances in code cracking or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers may present risks to cryptocurrencies, Digital Assets and Services, which could result in the theft or loss of your Digital Assets or property. To the extent possible, the Company intends to update the protocol underlying the Services to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but the Company does not guarantee or otherwise represent full security of the system. By using the Services or accessing the Site, you acknowledge these inherent risks. 


### 5.6. Volatility of Cryptocurrency 
You understand that Ethereum and other blockchain technologies and associated Digital Assets, currencies, or tokens are highly volatile due to many factors including but not limited to adoption, speculation, technology, and security risks. You also acknowledge that the cost of transacting on such technologies is variable and may increase at any time causing impact to any activities taking place on the Ethereum blockchain, including those facilitated by the Services.
