    <Heading as="h3">Right to restriction of processing</Heading>
    <Text as="p">
      You have the right to obtain from us the restriction of processing where one of the following
      applies:
    </Text>
    <ul>

        the accuracy of the personal data is contested by you, for a period enabling us to verify
        the accuracy of the personal data;
      </li>
      <li>
        the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of the personal data and request the
        restriction of their use instead;
      </li>
      <li>
        we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are

      <li>you have objected to processing pursuant to applicable laws.</li>
    </ul>

    <Heading as="h3">Right to object</Heading>
    <Text as="p">
      You have the right to object at any time, to the processing of your personal data where we are
      relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) as the legal basis for that
      particular use of your data. We shall no longer process the personal data in the event of the
      objection unless we can demonstrate reasonable grounds for the processing, which override the
      interests, rights and freedoms of you, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal
      claims.

    <Text as="p">

      your consent.

    <Text as="p">
      You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other
      rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded,
      repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these
      circumstances.

      your request to speed up our response.
