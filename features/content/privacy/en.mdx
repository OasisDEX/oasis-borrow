We may also use this data to facilitate individual access to the Site, Services and linked third-party websites, communicate with individuals regarding their use of the Services, and in other ways related to individual use of the Services and the Site.

The legal basis for this processing is that it is necessary to fulfill a contract with you, as well as our legitimate interests, such as monitoring and improving the Site, and the proper protection of the Site against risks.
