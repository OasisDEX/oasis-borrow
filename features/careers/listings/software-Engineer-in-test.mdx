## About Us
We are the company behind [Oasis.app](https://oasis.app/), the app to deploy your capital into the Maker Protocol and DeFi. With [Oasis.app](https://oasis.app/) you can borrow Dai or increase your exposure to your favourite crypto. Our mission is to provide the best and most trusted entry point to DeFi.

We are a team of passionate thinkers and builders. We are spread across Europe, and a few of us come from the Americas and Asia. Our engineering team is mostly allocated in Europe. You can decide to either work remotely or from our fantastic offices in Warsaw. 

We operate under Oazo Apps Limited, a company incorporated and registered in the United Kingdom.

## The technology
Our software is coded in JavaScript and TypeScript using RX.js, React (including hooks), Postgres, SQL, NoSQL, and GraphQL. While creating our apps, we also use blockchain-related technologies: Ethereum blockchain principles, Solidity, test-nets, and contract deployment scripts. Other tools and technologies we use include Bash scripting & DApp tools; Node.js, express, Next.js; Docker; CircleCI, CypressJS, Mocha, and Jest. We use Github actions for managing deploys, and Heroku for preview apps.

## The role
You would be a valued member of our engineering team, focusing on ensuring our software quality and collaborating with Product and Techops. This is both a technical role and a people role, and would likely include:

- Very close collaboration within the engineering team, mentoring, designing and advocating a modern testing approach towards confident, trivial, and quick production deploys.
- Setting up and maintaining testing infrastructure and environments, including deterministic blockchain testnets, and possibly UI and snapshot testing.
- Supporting tooling to engineers to write their own functional tests alongside new features. Mentoring, listening to their feedback and adjusting if necessary.
- Understanding when refactoring might require more targeted regression testing, leading those efforts, and maintaining a suite of regression tests that anyone can run.
- Bringing a testing mindset into our team, system and application design.
- Providing input and expertise into the approach to automated software testing - helping the team decide when different levels of tests are appropriate for given test coverage. Keeping an eye on the PRs.
-Developing and maintaining dashboards to give a view of our system health from a functional perspective.

There will be more things - roll your own. Throughout all of this is a healthy dose of “facilitating self-serve” - we want you to scale your efforts by providing tooling and knowledge to others. As a company, we want to ensure that the effort required to maintain software quality scales sub-linearly with the functionality.

For clarity - this is not a QA role.

## About you
The ideal candidate will have operated as a Software Engineer in Test before in a Web2 environment and is curious about applying these techniques to blockchain development (Web3) both on the front-end and the backend.

- Interest in and knowledge of application and system design, particularly from an automated-testing perspective.

## The nice to haves
- Experience in using Ethereum tools and building DApps accessing Ethereum blockchain
- Understanding of Blockchain primitives and applied cryptography
- Basic knowledge of DeFi and financial concepts and markets
- Degree in Engineering or Computer Science

## Compensation package
- Competitive fixed annual salary and yearly Dai bonus
- Employee share options and performance equity
- Paid time off - 5 weeks per year (or more if you need it), public holidays and 2-weeks end-of-year break
- Monthly subscription perks - can be anything you choose, from gym membership, fresh flower or fruit delivery, Netflix/Spotify/gaming subscription, etc.
