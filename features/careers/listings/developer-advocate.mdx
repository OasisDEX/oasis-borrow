## About Us
We are a team of passionate thinkers and builders that are committed to enabling more people and institutions to gain exposure to Decentralised Finance and crypto. Our mission is to provide the best and most trusted entry point to DeFi. Our [Oasis.app](https://oasis.app/) products provide users with the best user experience in the industry and inspire the highest levels of confidence.

We are a remote-first business, with most of our team spread across Europe and a few of us in the Americas and Asia. We operate under Oazo Apps Limited, a company incorporated and registered in the United Kingdom.

[Oasis.app](https://oasis.app/) is going through an exciting stage of growth having recently raised a [$6m Series A round](https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/defi-platform-oasisapp-raises-6m-in-series-a-round-led-by-libertus), and we have ambitious growth plans for 2022 and beyond.

## The role
As a Developer Advocate for oasis.app, you will join an experienced and energetic web3  team that is responsible for helping to drive the adoption of crypto and decentralised finance (DeFi). In this role, you’ll combine your unbridled passion and enthusiasm to generate awareness and adoption of the new API product that will allow third party businesses and institutions to connect to the Oasis.app infrastructure and allow their users a secure and trusted access point to DeFi. 

Ideally, you’re someone who comes from a software and/or infrastructure background, but has an unmet need to be helping guide the broader industry towards a technology and future you firmly believe in. You have immediate credibility with Startups, Developers, Architects, IT Managers and / or CTOs. You love to share your passion with others and exhibit good judgement in selecting strategic opportunities to do so.

Within the role, you’ll be expected to travel frequently, working with companies of all stages, including becoming embedded within accelerators and incubators as you learn the company requirements, as well as demonstrate and guide developers integrating the Oasis API. When you’re not working directly with companies, you’ll be interfacing with the dedicated API engineering team - providing feedback from integrators and helping the team understand bottlenecks.

<br/>

**Your responsibilities will include**
- Reaching out and engaging with Web3/Web2 technical companies and teams from across the globe with the aim to increase awareness and adoption of the Oasis API
- Work closely with individual development teams, helping them integrate for the first time, leading to creating keys and their first transactions in the sandbox.
- Write and maintain high-quality open-source documentation and code examples that enable developers to understand and build on the platform.
- Forming relationships within accelerators and incubators with a focus on Fintech and Web3 adoption and provide support to companies looking to build Web2 apps that connect to Web3
- Provide feedback and collaborate with the Oasis API engineering teams on enhancing the features, functionality and time to integration.

## About you

We are looking for an exceptional candidate, someone who is ambitious and highly motivated to take their first or next steps of their career in DeFi. The role will likely require a lot of travel and working with different companies across the globe, primarily in Europe and the Americas, so it would suit someone looking to see the world and embrace continually meeting and working with new people.

**You have or you are:**
- A technical background, either experience integrating APIs yourself or developer advocacy
- Ability to deliver high-quality code samples and documentation that engage developers in multiple languages and frameworks
- Knowledge of DeFi and the potential Web3 is bringing to traditional financial applications
- Great written and verbal communication skills
- Able to plan strategically, identifying the high value, lower cost opportunities and prioritising your time accordingly


## What’s in it for you
- All travel, accommodation and food costs covered by the company when travelling
- Valuable industry experience working in the cutting edge DeFi sector 
- Independence, accountability and autonomy in your day to day work, with support when you need it
- Competitive fixed annual salary, depending on the level of experience, and a yearly performance bonus paid in Dai
- Employee share options and performance equity
- Paid time off: 5 weeks per year (or more if you need it), public holidays and 2-weeks end-of-year break
- Annual company retreats and participation in industry events fully covered by the business
- Monthly subscription perks - can be anything you choose, from gym membership, fresh flower or fruit delivery, Netflix/Spotify/gaming subscription, etc.
