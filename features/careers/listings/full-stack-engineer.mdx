## About us
We are a team of passionate thinkers and builders committed to enabling more people and institutions to gain exposure to Decentralised Finance and crypto. At Oasis.app we are driven by the core values that guide us:

- Build the most trusted place to deploy capital into DeFi
- Create with our superpower in mind, transparency
- A borderless Oasis

We are a remote-first business, with most of our team spread across Europe and a few of us in the Americas and Asia. We operate under Oazo Apps Limited, a company incorporated and registered in the United Kingdom.

[Oasis.app](https://oasis.app/) is going through an exciting growth stage, having raised a [$6m Series A round](https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/defi-platform-oasisapp-raises-6m-in-series-a-round-led-by-libertus) in February 2022, and we have ambitious growth plans for 2023 and beyond.

## The role
We're seeking a talented Full-Stack Engineer to join our team and help us build cutting-edge solutions for DeFi.
