## About Us
We are a team of passionate thinkers and builders committed to enabling more people and institutions to get crypto exposure. We develop [Oasis.app](https://oasis.app/), the app to deploy your capital into the Maker Protocol and DeFi.

Our mission is to provide the best and most trusted entry point to deploy your capital to DeFi.

We operate under Oazo Apps Limited, a company incorporated and registered in the United Kingdom.

## The role

We are looking for someone to guide our engineering function. Someone who will wear the CTO hat and become part of our senior leadership team with a direct impact on our strategic direction. 

As a CTO at [Oasis.app](https://oasis.app/), you will ensure an optimal working environment for our engineering team to deliver high-quality code and reliable applications. We are seeking to reflect changes in the regulatory and technology landscape in our product and identify ways to integrate with the existing fintech and finance landscape. 

## What are we looking for
- Solid experience in leading tech teams in a growth company, covering engineering, operations and security 
- Demonstrated ability to set technical vision for a mission-driven engineering team 
- Excellent planning capabilities that directly impact the success of the product 
- Orientation towards innovation and continuously seeking new ways to expand our product offering 
- Experience in conveying the vision of our organisation, both internally and externally 
- Solid experience in delivering products in Agile environments
- Experience in building FinTech products and integrating with ecosystem partners

## What will make you stand out
- Experience in using Ethereum tools, building DApps accessing Ethereum blockchain
- Knowledge of DeFi and understanding of Blockchain primitives

## What’s in it for you 
- Independence, accountability and ownership in your daily operations
- Leading a team of best in class engineers that are committed to decentralisation and building the future financial infrastructure
- Competitive fixed annual salary and yearly Dai bonus
- Employee share options and performance equity
- Paid time off: 5 weeks per year (or more if you need it), public holidays and 2-weeks end-of-year break
- Annual company retreats and participation in industry conferences fully covered
- Monthly subscription perks - can be anything you choose, from gym membership, fresh flower or fruit delivery, Netflix/Spotify/gaming subscription, etc.

## The Tech Stack

We are firm believers in decentralisation and cryptocurrencies. Our tech stack relies on the Ethereum public infrastructure, and Solidity Smart Contracts power the logic of the [Oasis.app](https://oasis.app/).

With this in mind, we don’t expect our technical leader to have previous experience with these technologies, as what we need is a strong leader and strategic thinker. 

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript, RxJS (we heavily leverage RxJS observables to create a view state by polling contracts on the blockchain directly, composing with user events) 
- **Backend**: Caching layers written in TypeScript with SQL and NoSQL, exposing GraphQL endpoints. NestJS, Postgres and Redis for automation capabilities, manipulating smart contracts under certain conditions
- **Infrastructure**:  Docker; CircleCI, CypressJS, Mocha, Chai, Jest

Although the preference is for people from a vast engineering background, you wouldn’t need hands-on experience with all of the above.
